# ST422-Team-3

This repository attempts to create an analysis report based on client brief 6 
which is an evidence-based, decision-ready understanding of long-run and seasonal 
temperature change in Central England using the Met Office HadCET seasonal mean, 
minimum and maximum temperature series (v2.1.0.0). 


## What this repo produces [STC]

[WIP] A client-facing report that follows the required structure:

1. Introduction
2. Client brief
3. Data description
4. Baseline summary of data characteristics
5. Claim
6. Data and approach (plain language)
7. Evidence
   - Table 1 + interpretation
   - Visualisation 1 + interpretation
   - Visualisation 2 + interpretation
8. Uncertainty and limitations (1-3 items, each with impact)
9. Recommendation and next steps

Outputs are written to:
- outputs/tables/
- outputs/figures/
- rendered report in reports/

Meeting Minutes and Action log is present in 'management/ST422_group_contact_log.'
For more information on those please refer to the README.md present in that folder.

## Quick start

To be filled in. 

## Dataset selection
